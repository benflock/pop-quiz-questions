I just want to say that even though I bitch about the quizzes, I feel they are great for self-reflection, understanding concepts, and interview preparation.

1. I feel that quizzes are a great way to teach higher order functions.

2. I also feel that quizzes should have new material that was from the same day or previous day's lecture as well as material that from earlier in the course.

3. I could use CSS questions to instill what I learned.
